# Matrix-Rotation
Program to rotate a matrix and display the sum of it's diagonal elements

### Problem statement
Write a file which will take a square matrix from the user and output the sum of it's diagonal elements and then rotate the matrix clockwise. The number of rows and columns will be entered by the user. The number of rotations will also be entered by the user. The program will also output the sum of the diagonal elements of the rotated matrix. The program will only accept a square matrix from user. If the number of rows and columns entered by the user are different, then the output will be "Square matrix not formed".

After rotating the matrix, the program will give the user two choices-
1. Continue
2. Exit

The program will keep on accepting inputs from the user until the user chooses to exit.

### Example
The sample inputs and their corresponding expected outputs are shown in the file "console.txt".
